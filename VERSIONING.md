Semantic versioning
===================

Starting with Contao 4.0, we will be using [semantic versioning][1].


What does this mean?
--------------------

 * Bugfix releases must only contain backwards compatible bug fixes.
 * Minor releases can contain new backwards compatible features.
 * Any incompatible API change must be released as a new major version.


API changes
-----------

Not everything that is backwards incompatible is also an API change! The API
includes the public and the protected methods of the Contao PHP classes, unless
they are declared as `@internal`.

Template files are explicitely not part of the API and thus can be changed in
minor and bugfix releases, even if the change might break a customized version
of the template or require to adjust CSS code to the new markup.


Ramifications
-------------

Using semantic versioning also means that new major versions might be released
more often than in the past.
